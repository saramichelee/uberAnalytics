##Final Observations
1. The average fare of a ride is more where there are less rides taken per city, usually in rural areas. Probably due to there being generally less drivers, accessiblity decreases.
2. 5.3% of all ride in the data set occur in rural areas, yet rural areas only contain 2.6% of all drivers. The ratio of drivers to rides is less in smaller cities, in general drivers in rural areas have to complete more rides on average.
3. Rides in bigger cities generall have lower fares. Could be due to locations being closer together, therefore less miles traveled resulting in a lower fare. Or possibly lower fare is a result of there are more drivers.
